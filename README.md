# Task 5 – SQL Joins

 Description:
This task demonstrates how to use different types of SQL joins — `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` — to combine and analyze data from multiple related tables in a relational database.

 Concepts Used:
- Joins and table relationships
- Matching records between tables
- Handling missing/mismatched data

 Output Includes:
1. Orders with user names using INNER JOIN  
2. All users with/without orders using LEFT JOIN  
3. All orders with/without user info using RIGHT JOIN  
4. A full list of users and orders using simulated FULL OUTER JOIN  

 Tools Used:
- MySQL Workbench (can also run on SQLite with adjustments)
